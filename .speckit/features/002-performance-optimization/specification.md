# Performance Optimization System

## What We Want to Build

A comprehensive performance optimization system that ensures the platform meets Core Web Vitals standards and provides excellent user experience across all devices and network conditions.

## Why We Need This

- Current bundle size is large with many dependencies affecting load times
- No performance monitoring to identify bottlenecks
- Missing code splitting and lazy loading optimizations
- No caching strategy for frequently accessed data
- Performance issues on mobile devices and slow networks

## User Stories

### As a User
- I want the app to load in under 3 seconds on any device
- I want smooth animations and interactions without lag
- I want the app to work well on slow network connections
- I want the app to be responsive and fast on mobile devices

### As a Developer
- I want to monitor performance metrics in real-time
- I want to identify performance bottlenecks quickly
- I want to optimize bundle size and loading times
- I want to implement caching strategies effectively

### As a Business
- I want to improve user engagement through better performance
- I want to reduce bounce rates caused by slow loading
- I want to improve SEO rankings through better Core Web Vitals
- I want to reduce server costs through better caching

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Core Web Vitals score > 90
- [ ] First Contentful Paint < 1.5s
- [ ] Largest Contentful Paint < 2.5s
- [ ] Cumulative Layout Shift < 0.1
- [ ] First Input Delay < 100ms
- [ ] Bundle size reduced by 30%
- [ ] Mobile performance score > 85
- [ ] Performance monitoring dashboard operational

## Technical Requirements

- Bundle analysis and optimization
- Code splitting by route and feature
- Lazy loading for heavy components
- Image optimization and compression
- Caching strategy implementation
- Performance monitoring and analytics
- Mobile-specific optimizations
- Network-aware loading strategies
