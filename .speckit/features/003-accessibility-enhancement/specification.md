# Accessibility Enhancement System

## What We Want to Build

A comprehensive accessibility system that ensures the platform meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards and provides an inclusive experience for all users, including those with disabilities.

## Why We Need This

- Current accessibility features are basic and don't meet modern standards
- Missing screen reader support for many components
- No keyboard navigation for complex interactions
- Color contrast issues in some UI elements
- No accessibility testing or validation

## User Stories

### As a User with Visual Impairments
- I want to use screen readers to navigate the app effectively
- I want high contrast modes and large text options
- I want audio descriptions for important visual content
- I want keyboard navigation for all interactive elements

### As a User with Motor Impairments
- I want to navigate the app using only the keyboard
- I want large click targets for interactive elements
- I want voice control support where possible
- I want customizable interaction timeouts

### As a User with Cognitive Impairments
- I want clear, simple language throughout the app
- I want consistent navigation patterns
- I want error messages that are easy to understand
- I want the ability to customize the interface

### As a Developer
- I want automated accessibility testing in CI/CD
- I want accessibility guidelines and best practices
- I want tools to validate accessibility compliance
- I want performance metrics for accessibility features
